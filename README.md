# 🧩 R3C-Operating-System
**Build with no LLVM**  
*From Compiler Independence to System Autonomy.*

---

## 🧱 Overview
**R3C-Operating-System** is a minimal yet industrial-grade experimental operating system,  
**built entirely on the R3C ecosystem philosophy** — *no LLVM, no external dependency, and full transparency from source to metal.*

This project extends the **R3C compiler** lineage into the **system layer**, realizing the vision of:
> “From C++ to Rust to ASM — now to the Operating System itself.”

---

## 🪶 Philosophy
- **No LLVM, No External Backend**
  - All components are compiled, linked, and assembled through the **R3C transpiler chain** (C++ → Rust → NASM).
- **Full Source Visibility**
  - Every stage of the build process is traceable, human-readable, and modifiable.
- **Cross-Platform Independence**
  - Designed to be portable across **x86_64**, **ARM64**, and **RISC-V** with minimal modification.
- **Industrial Longevity**
  - Built under the *R3C Industrial Philosophy*: Long-term sustain, simple architecture, maintainable over decades.

## 🧭 Architecture Roadmap
| Layer | Component | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| 🧱 Compiler | [r3c](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) | LLVM-free C++ → Rust → ASM transpiler |
| 📦 Package | [cpppm](https://github.com/0200134/cpppm) | Cross-platform package & build system |
| 🦀 Language | [Rust-LTSS](https://github.com/0200134/Rust-ltss) | Long-Term Sustain System for Rust |
| 🖥️ System | **R3C-Operating-System** | OS built upon the full R3C stack |

## ⚙️ Build Concept



C++  →  R3C Transpiler  →  Rust IR  →  ASM (NASM)  →  Bootloader / Kernel


- **No clang / gcc / llvm** in the pipeline.  
- Uses `cpppm` to manage cross-platform dependencies.  
- Will later integrate with `Rust-LTSS` runtime layer for stable memory and concurrency.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Bootable kernel with R3C-native ABI
- Pure ASM I/O layer with Rust-LTSS runtime hooks
- Expandable driver and syscall table
- Cross-build for Raspberry Pi, Linux, macOS, and x86_64 targets

---

## 🧠 Vision
> “R3C-OS is not another kernel.  
> It’s the first *LLVM-free breathing system*.”

This repository represents the **final stage** of the R3C industrial independence experiment —  
proving that a complete system, from compiler to OS, can **exist without LLVM**.
